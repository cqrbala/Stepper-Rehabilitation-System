# Stepper-Rehabilitation-System
## Contributors: Balakumar, Haran, Arnav

A system deployed on a stepper that is found in any gym, the system is used for patients who have had lower limb muscle atrophy due to stroke and helps them in their recovery process.

The system can record the amount of strength the patient can grip the handle with (using a Force Sensing Resistor), the distance covered and progress made by the patient (algorithm based on the number of steps and pressure applied), and also the muscle contraction for the calf (using an EMG sensor)
